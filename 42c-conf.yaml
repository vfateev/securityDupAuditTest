# This example shows how to map API files in your repository to APIs you
# already have in 42Crunch Platform.
#
# When the CI/CD plugin starts, it creates an API collection in 42Crunch Platform
# using the name of the repository and branch directly from your source control.
#
# The plugin uploads any APIs it finds during the discovery phase
# into this API collection On subsequent runs, the collection is kept is sync
# with the API files in your source repository.
#
# If you have APIs in other API collections on 42Crunch Platform that you 
# would like like to keep in sync with changes in the files in your source control,
# you can use mappings for this.
#
# To configure the mapping, you must know the API UUID of the existing API
# in 42Crunch Platform (you can check it in the API summary on 
# the platform). You list the filenames and the corresponding API UUIDs 
# in the 'mapping' section.
#
# In this example, the sample 'petstore.json' file is mapped, and the plugin uploads 
# it to the platform updating the contents of the API with
# the UUID 'e7cd62ce-1ee9-4320-af33-8bd9519c6f48' with the contents of the file from
# the source code repository.
#
# On the other hand, the sample file 'petstore.yaml' is not mapped,
# so the plugin uploads to its default API collection.
